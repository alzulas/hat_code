This code requires that you have the arduino IDE and the RA8875 library installed.

In the RA8875 library, you'll find
* code to teach you how to display text
* code to teach you how to make colors and shapes which also has a bit of touch screen code
* code to upload an image, I never figured out how to make that work, but I've included the image that I want to upload just incase.
